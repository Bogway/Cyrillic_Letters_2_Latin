# Cyrillic_Lttters_2_Latin

While watching some website started with a 'p', I suddenly have a crush on a russian actor, Markus. Then my interst for russian language get inspired. However, I can't pronounce russian at all. So I try to transform all the russian letters to latin letters so that I can pronounce them easily.
